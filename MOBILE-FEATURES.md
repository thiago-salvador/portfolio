# 📱 Mobile-Specific Features

This document outlines all mobile-optimized features and interactions implemented in the portfolio.

## 🎯 Overview

The portfolio is fully optimized for mobile devices with native-like interactions, gestures, and feedback mechanisms.

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 1. Touch Gestures & Swipe Navigation

#### Gesture Carousel
**Component**: `gesture-carousel.tsx`

**Features**:
- **Swipe to Navigate**: Natural left/right swipe gestures
- **Momentum Physics**: Realistic inertia when swiping
- **Drag Elastic**: Smooth resistance at boundaries
- **Visual Indicators**: Animated dots for current position
- **Swipe Hint**: Shows on first view with animated arrow

**Usage**:
```tsx
<GestureCarousel
  items={[<Item1 />, <Item2 />, <Item3 />]}
  className="h-96"
/>
```

**Gesture Support**:
- Touch swipe (mobile)
- Mouse drag (desktop)
- Trackpad swipe (desktop)

#### Projects Accordion Swipe
**Location**: `projects-accordion.tsx`

**Features**:
- Responsive card layout (1 card on mobile, 4 on desktop)
- Arrow navigation with bounce feedback at ends
- Smooth transitions between slides
- No animations during carousel navigation (as requested)

---

### 2. Pull-to-Refresh

**Component**: `pull-to-refresh.tsx`

**Features**:
- **Native iOS/Android Feel**: Smooth elastic pull
- **Visual Indicator**: Animated arrow that rotates as you pull
- **Threshold System**: Must pull 80px to trigger
- **Haptic Feedback**: Vibration at threshold and on refresh
- **Loading State**: Spinning loader during refresh

**How It Works**:
1. Pull down from top of page (must be scrolled to top)
2. Arrow rotates as you pull
3. At 80px threshold, haptic feedback triggers
4. Release to refresh
5. Loading spinner appears
6. Content refreshes (in this case, new random featured project)

**Implementation**:
```tsx
<PullToRefresh onRefresh={handleRefresh}>
  {/* Your content */}
</PullToRefresh>
```

**Applied To**: Home page (wraps entire main content)

### 3. Bottom Sheet Modal (Mobile-Only)

**Component**: `mobile-bottom-sheet.tsx`

**Features**:
- **Replaces Center Modal**: On mobile, projects open in bottom sheet instead of center modal
- **Drag Handle**: Visual indicator at top for dragging
- **Swipe Down to Close**: Pull down 150px to dismiss
- **Elastic Drag**: Smooth resistance when dragging
- **Backdrop Blur**: Blurred background with tap-to-close
- **Haptic Feedback**: Vibrations on open, close, and threshold
- **Rounded Top**: Modern iOS-style rounded corners

**Interactions**:
- Swipe down to close
- Tap backdrop to close
- Press ESC key to close
- Click project tags (with haptic feedback)
- Full-width CTA button with haptic on tap

**vs Desktop Modal**:
- Desktop: Center modal with scale animation
- Mobile: Bottom sheet with slide-up animation
- Automatically switches based on screen size

### 4. Haptic Feedback

**Hook**: `useHaptic.ts`

**Types Available**:
- `light` (10ms) - Selection, hover, minor interactions
- `medium` (20ms) - Button taps, toggles
- `heavy` (30ms) - Important actions, confirmations
- `success` [10, 50, 10] - Success messages
- `warning` [20, 100, 20] - Warning alerts
- `error` [30, 100, 30, 100, 30] - Error states
- `selection` (5ms) - Very light selection feedback

**Usage**:
```tsx
import { useHaptic } from "@/hooks/useHaptic";

const { triggerHaptic } = useHaptic();

// On button click
onClick={() => {
  triggerHaptic("medium");
  // Your action
}}
```

**Applied To**:
- ✅ Mobile bottom sheet (open, close, drag threshold, tag taps)
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh (threshold, refresh trigger)
- ✅ Mobile navigation drawer (open, close, nav clicks, social links)
- ✅ Easter eggs (logo clicks, konami code)
- ✅ All interactive elements in mobile components

**Browser Support**:
- Works on Android devices
- Works on iOS Safari (iOS 13+)
- Gracefully degrades on unsupported browsers
